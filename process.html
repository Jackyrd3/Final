        <P id="process-description">Our process is unique in that we let our designers take inspirations from their own hobbies, memories and beautiful moments. This way we can always feel like we are not just working on a design, but enjoying the process of creating something that is meaningful to us. <br>
            All designers work from home, as we feel incresingly inspired being in places that bring joy to us, rather than being in one place. Nevertheless we remain in close contact with each other by spending time outside of work doing activities that keep us connected and thriving. 
            <br> We look forward to bring you the best designs, made by unique people, for unique people. 
        </P>
