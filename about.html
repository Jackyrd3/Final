            I felt the metal of the brake lever clink against the handle of my 1965 vespa as it glided on the road––finding its own autonomy at 40 miles per hour.<br> I tried to squeeze, once again, as the agonizing reality of the lack of effort from a single muscle flexor enveloped me. That was just too bad; I was only microseconds from an electrifying pain that traveled from my once- trying-wrist, all the way to my shoulder.  
This is not the best scenario for a 23 year old college graduate with a life full of plans and ambition. Except, I was not exactly that. I graduated with a degree in graphic design that I traded for the joy of working on my 1971 Triumph Bonneville and 1965 Vespa. I lived in immense guilt for not utilizing my knowledge and expensive paper to build a career. 
<br>Months of a cast and aching wrists made me realize how much I did enjoy designing––I missed it. I designed vibrant, unordinary patterns in my head that I would have been proud of others to see. I equally missed fixing my vehicles, a hobby I’d embraced since childhood. 
Then one day the dots just…connected.
I saw my designs as decals, adorning the body of my vespa and Boneville as they elevated the essence of the vehicles themselves; displaying a sense of personality. 
Thank you to my lucky accident, I aspire to provide passion in all my designs to give your vehicle personality. I create with appreciation for design and intent to elevate your vehicle, knowing how important they can be to our lives.
